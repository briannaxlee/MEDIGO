<center><p>
  1. Open the airway. With the person lying on his or her back, tilt the head back slightly to lift the chin.
  <br>
  <br>
  2. Check for breathing. Listen carefully, for no more than 10 seconds, for sounds of breathing.
   If there is no breathing begin CPR.<br>
   <br>
  3. Push hard, push fast. Place your hands, one on top of the other, in the middle of the chest. Use your body weight to help you administer compressions that are at least 2 inches deep and delivered at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  4. Deliver rescue breaths. With the person's head tilted back slightly and the chin lifted,
  pinch the nose shut and place your mouth over the person's mouth to make a complete seal.
  Blow into the person's mouth to make the chest rise. Deliver two rescue breaths,
   then continue compressions.
   <br>
   <br>
  4.1 Note: If the chest does not rise with the initial rescue breath,
  re-tilt the head before delivering the second breath. If the chest doesn't rise with the second breath,
  the person may be choking. After each subsequent set of 100 chest compressions, and before attempting
  breaths, look for an object and, if seen, remove it.
  <br>
  <br>
  5.Continue CPR steps. Keep performing cycles of chest compressions and breathing until the person
  exhibits signs of life, such as breathing, an AED becomes available, or EMS or a trained medical
  responder arrives on scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  5.1 Note: End the cycles if the scene becomes unsafe or you cannot continue performing CPR
  due to exhaustion.
